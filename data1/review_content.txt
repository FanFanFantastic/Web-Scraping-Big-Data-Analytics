I have extended family in Tempe and every time I visit we save one lunch or dinner for Four Peaks.

This is one of the best breweries in town. It's almost always busy with people enjoying a good chat over excellent selections of drink and food. It has a few large TV screens for those interested in watching sports. The service is excellent.
