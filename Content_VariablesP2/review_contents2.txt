Went on a recommendation from a friend. Offered two "flights" on the menu. One o
f 8, one of four. Since they had 8 "regular" and 4 "seasonal" brews, I did both
and tried every beer. ALL were good, with only 1 of the 12 being slightly underw
helming to me (though others I was with loved it.) Staff was very friendly...

Came here because of TripAdvisor recommendation, and as usual, it was spot on. L
arge place, with great seating indoors and out. I ordered the flight of house be

 amazing, my husband couldn't stop raving about the beer...we'll be making our w
ay back to...
